# Welcome to xarray-simlab-ode's documentation!

Xarray-simlab-ode provides the `xso` framework for building and solving models based on ordinary differential 
equations (ODEs), an extension of [xarray-simlab](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-simlab).

Xarray-simlab provides a generic framework for building computational models in a modular fashion 
and a [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) extension for setting and running simulations using xarray's `Dataset` 
structure.

Xarray-simlab-ode (XSO) extends the Xarray-simlab framework with a set of variables, processes and a solver backend, 
suited towards ODE-based models. It is designed for flexible, interactive and reproducible modeling workflows.

*Note: This project is in the early stages of development.*
