Welcome to xarray-simlab-ode's documentation!
#############################################

Xarray-simlab-ode provides the `xso` framework for building and solving models based on ordinary differential 
equations (ODEs), an extension of `xarray-simlab <https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-simlab>`__.

Xarray-simlab provides a generic framework for building computational models in a modular fashion 
and a `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/>`__ extension for setting and running simulations using xarray's ``Dataset``
structure.

Xarray-simlab-ode (XSO) extends the Xarray-simlab framework with a set of variables, processes and a solver backend, 
suited towards ODE-based models. It is designed for flexible, interactive and reproducible modeling workflows.

.. Note:: This project is in the early stages of development.
