# xarray-simlab-ode

The`xso`Framework for building and solving ODE-based models, an extension of xarray-simlab.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install xso
```

## Usage
A highly simplified model based on ordinary differential equations is shown below.
1. Create Create new model components by writing compact Python classes:
```python
import xso

@xso.component
class Variable:
    var = xso.variable(description='basic state variable')

@xso.component
class LinearGrowth:
    var_ext = xso.variable(foreign=True, flux='growth', description='external state variable')
    rate = xso.parameter(description='linear growth rate')
    @xso.flux
    def growth(self, var_ext, rate):
        return var_ext * rate
```
2. Create a new model just by providing a dictionary of model components:

```python
model = xso.create({'Var':Variable,'Growth':LinearGrowth})
```
3. Create an input xarray.Dataset, run the model and get an output xarray.Dataset:

```python
input_ds = xso.setup(solver='stepwise',
                     model=model,
                     input_vars={
                         'Var':{'var_label':'X', 'var_init':1},
                         'Growth':{'var':'A', 'rate':1.},
                     })

with model:
    output_ds = input_ds.xsimlab.run()
```
4.Perform model setup, pre-processing, run, post-processing and visualization in a functional style, using method chaining:
```python
'xxx'
```
